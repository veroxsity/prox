# prox
This app is a useful one as it turns a list of proxies into a list of working proxies that can be used for any app.

1. Head to https://https://free-proxy-list.net/# and then copy the raw ip list.
2. Paste the proxy list into proxies.txt
3. Run Prox.exe and wait
4. 
The proxies then will have "http://" prepended to them and all of the non working ones will be removed. this proxy
list then can be used in apps or a browser.
